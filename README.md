This repository showcases a common error when working with raw pointers and vectors in Rust.  The example demonstrates how modifying a vector via a raw pointer can cause unexpected behavior if the vector's capacity is modified after obtaining the pointer. The solution demonstrates a safe and correct way to achieve the same result.  This is crucial to understand for safe and reliable Rust development when interacting with lower-level memory management.
